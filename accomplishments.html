    <p>Throughout Highschool I competed in the FBLA Mobile Application Development competition. In my 2 times competing, below are the results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sophomore Year: <B>5th Place in State</B>, went to Nationals</li>
        <li>Junior Year: <B>2nd Place in State</B>, went to Nationals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After Highschool, I went to work Full-Time at <a href="https://www.quiktrip.com">QuikTrip</a> while attending College Full-Time, which was challenging but I am glad I did it. Since then I have moved on to working in the IT field Full-Time while still attending College Full-Time at the <I>University of Missouri - Columbia</I></p>
