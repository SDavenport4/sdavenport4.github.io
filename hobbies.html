    <p>I have a few different hobbies that I enjoy</p>

    <h3>Cars</h3>
    <p>I have always had a big passion for cars, especially fast ones. Once I graduated High School and began working full time, I got myself a Kia Stinger GT as a gift to myself. I modded it out with every mod possible, and enjoyed taking it to the track to race. This car taught me everything I know about cars. Since then I have traded the Stinger in to purchase my dream car, a Tesla Model 3 Performance. I set the goal to purchase one before I turned 21 a few years back, and I am proud to have accomplished my goal. I have taken this to the track once and had a blast with the insane torque it has.</p>

    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Since Middle School, I have had a passion for computers and developing things. I taught myself everything I know about programming, including multiple languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>Swift (iOS Apps)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I always am wanting to learn new things and expand my knowledge, so I spend a lot of my free time at a computer learning and programming, even though its not for School! Recently I just got a job at QuarkWorks in Columbia, MO creating Mobile Apps!</p>

    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <p>Another big hobby of mine is Gaming. I typically only play one game at a time until I am bored of it. I used to be a console gamer, until I bought a PC, and then I have not gone back to console since. Currently, my game of choice is Valorant. I am so invested into the game, that I am actually a member of the Club Valorant team here at Mizzou.</p>
